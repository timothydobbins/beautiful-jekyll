I am an Associate Professor at the [National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre](https://ndarc.med.unsw.edu.au/ "NDARC"), [UNSW](https://www.unsw.edu.au/). I received my PhD in Biostatistics in 2005 from the University of Sydney where I examined methods for analysing longitudinal data collected from cluster randomised trials. As a biostatistician with over ten years' postdoctoral experience, I have experience in many fields of biostatistics, including randomised controlled trials and meta-analysis, and have familiarity with Bayesian methods.

My current research focus is on applying biostatistical methods in drug and alcohol research. I have a strong interest in working with routinely collected administrative data to obtain real-world evidence about major health issues. This type of observational data requires careful use of regression methods to adjust for factors that might be associated with an exposure, so that an exposure effect can be estimated with minimal bias and maximum precision.

My interest in the analysis of correlated data has provided experience in using methods that relax standard assumptions of independence. I have published a number of papers using multilevel models, for example investigating between-hospital variation in surgical outcomes accounting for important patient differences. I have also published a series of papers from a large, state-wide survey of school children sampled using a stratified, clustered design where responses from students within schools were correlated.

I regularly provide statistical review for manuscripts submitted to the Medical Journal of Australia. I am Deputy Chair of the NSW Population Health and Health Services Research Ethics Committee, where I use my experience in analysing linked data to provide scientific and ethical review of projects using or linking to routinely collected data.
